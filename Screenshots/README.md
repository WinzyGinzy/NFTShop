# This is a Drupal eCommerce website that lets you setup a shop which can sell various products and their licenses to a specific user. 

The user can buy a licensed file by clicking the "Add to Cart" button which will then give them a notification saying that the product was successfully added to their cart.
 
Then, if the user goes to their cart in order to check the listed products they can click the "Checkout" button which will then proceed to take them to a screen asking for a 
payment method. 

After the user selects the payment method he is taken to a screen which requires him to create an account in the database which actions are tracked in the admin 
panel, if the user doesn't register themself they are not allowed to proceed any further with the payment. 

After they register themselves and input the correct credit card data they are taken to a "Complete" screen which demonstrates that their purchase has went through, then if you click the "Click here to view your order" message you will be taken to a detailed receipt
of your "transaction". 

- You can also enter your account through the navigation menu and see various tabs there detailing all of your orders, basic account information and the products you own.
- Has a promotion feature which can be seen during payment
